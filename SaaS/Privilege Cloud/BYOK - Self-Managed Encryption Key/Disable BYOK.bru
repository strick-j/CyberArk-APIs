  ## Disable BYOK
  This API stops data encryption within Privilege Cloud using your AWS key.
  
  As a result of this action, Privilege Cloud stops using your encryption key and switches to the Privilege Cloud encryption key.
  
  > ***IMPORTANT***
  > - The Disable BYOK API deactivates BYOK and the system encryption and decryption mechanisms are reset to use the CyberArk key.
  > - This step takes about 15 minutes. During this time:
  >   - The BYOK status indicates the key is being replaced and you cannot perform any BYOK-related action
  >   - Ensure that the encryption key remains in the same location and is not modified in any way.
  > - System functionality is stopped and returns to full operational functionality within a short while.
  
  > ***IMPORTANT***
  > - Customers that configured BYOK using Gen1 KMS policy (prior to May 2024)
  >   - CyberArk continues to support the Gen1 KMS policy. There is no need to upgrade to Gen2 KMS policy.
  >   - If you decide to upgrade to Gen2 KMS policy, after replacing the KMS policy, wait 10 minutes before performing a BYOK action.
