  ## Enable BYOK
  This API starts data encryption within Privilege Cloud using your KMS key.
  
  The result indicates that your key is used for data encryption within Privilege Cloud.
  
  > ***IMPORTANT***
  > - The Enable BYOK API deactivates BYOK and the system encryption and decryption mechanisms are reset to use the CyberArk key.
  > - This step takes about 20 minutes. During this time:
  >   - The BYOK status indicates the key is being replaced and you cannot perform any BYOK-related action
  >   - Ensure that the encryption key remains in the same location and is not modified in any way.
  > - **To check your system is functioning properly:**
  >   - After approximately 20 minutes, sign in to Privilege Cloud Portal or run the BYOK Status API to check your accounts are accessible, and continue working as usual.
  
  > ***WARNING***
  > - When employing BYOK, the customer is solely responsible for safeguarding the encryption key.
  > - In case CyberArk does not have access to your key, for example, in case of deletion, loss, or alteration of the key, you will not be able to access your encrypted data.
  > - CyberArk does not store a copy of your encryption key, does not maintain any alternate means of accessing your encrypted data, and will not be able to recover your encrypted secrets or recorded sessions.
  > - The Bring Your Own Key service is subject to the "Bring Your Own Key" provision in CyberArk's SaaS Terms of Service.
  
  > ***IMPORTANT***
  > - Customers that configured BYOK using Gen1 KMS policy (prior to May 2024)
  >   - CyberArk continues to support the Gen1 KMS policy. There is no need to upgrade to Gen2 KMS policy.
  >   - If you decide to upgrade to Gen2 KMS policy, after replacing the KMS policy, wait 10 minutes before performing a BYOK action.
